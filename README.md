# iOS Tech Challenge

Here at ABA English we love Music and we know our users do it also!

We want to give them the opportunity to learn English while singing their favourite songs.

Actually we have a current section that we would like to improve and restyle.

Users would be able to search content by artist name and enjoy it while singing.

Results should be presented in a modern fashion way.

Usability is a most for us and we would like to have a fresh user experience.

Feel free to modify anything you think would improve the section.

You can find some inspiration in the Apple Music application.

Aspects that we are going to value:

* Clean code

* Dependency injection

* Testing

It should be App Store ready.

We expect you to fork our repository to share your solution with us.
